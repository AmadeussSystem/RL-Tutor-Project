## How to Add More Questions

To add more JEE questions, you can:

1. **Edit the script**: Open `populate_jee_questions.py` and add more questions to the `JEE_QUESTIONS` list following the same format.

2. **Run the script again**: 
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python populate_jee_questions.py
   ```
   
   The script will skip questions that already exist and only add new ones.

## Example Question Format
```python
{
    "title": "Your Question Title",
    "description": "Brief description",
    "topic": "algebra",  # or mechanics, optics, etc.
    "difficulty": 7,  # 1-10 scale
    "content_type": "multiple_choice",
    "question_text": "The actual question text with values",
    "options": json.dumps(["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]),
    "correct_answer": "Option B",
    "explanation": "Step-by-step solution showing how to arrive at the answer",
    "tags": json.dumps(["topic", "subtopic", "jee_main", "difficulty_level"])
}
```

## Testing Your Questions
